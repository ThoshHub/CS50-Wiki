Wiki:

    \Need to create admin user
        \Actually might not need one because 

    Need to complete entry page
        Need to create HTML page for it
        Need to create view for it
            Need to make it so that the view serves the HTML page
            and dynamically grabs all entries within the /entries directory
            It then loops through them to generate the link to each page
